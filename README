Your tasks:

Using JavaScript, jQuery, Spotter, and Bootstrap create a client-side web application that tracks some information on twitter relating to a certain search term and visualizes that information in some way.

1) Your application must use an input box that allows the user to type in a search term.
2) It must use at least one Spotter object that is gathering data from Twitter
3) It must use several variables that keep track of some kind of information relating to the search term
4) It must use some form of jQuery animations, like fadeIn or fadeOut
5) Your code must be organized as in Lab 3, and must be readable and maintainable
6) You must work alone on this project (there will be opportunities for collaboration in the future)
7) You must set up a separate github project for this. If it is a private project, you must add me as a collaborator
8) You'll need to submit a link to your github project on Moodle by 11:55 PM on Friday, February 17

Your Github project must include at least 10 commits over the course of 5 different days. Each commit should have a meaningful commit message that explains exactly what was changed since the last iteration.
